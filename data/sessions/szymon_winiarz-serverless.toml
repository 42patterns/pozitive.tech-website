abstract = """In my presentation I'd like to talk about a topic being "the hottest buzzword" in 2016, that means Serverless Architecture. I'm going to say a few words about existing Serverless solutions, but I'm going to focus mainly on one of them, (not very similar to the others) which is Fn Project. During my presentation I'll try to introduce you to this platform, show you how to start working with it and what actually can we achieve with it. I'll mention also some more advanced aspects related to Fn Project"""

title = "Taming content delivery at scale"
language = "en"
abstract = """Nowadays web platforms are composed of multiple parts - large applications are surrounded by countless of smaller services and tiny serverless functions. If you’ve ever started a transition from a monolith to more distributed model you know that’s very rarely a big bang. It’s a long process that takes time. You take one feature, extract it to a module and define a clear API, so it can be incorporated easily into a bigger picture that you’re building.

Eventually you end up with a complex distributed platform that has to be managed somehow.  Deployments, traffic routing, security, reliability - you have to consider all of those aspects in your implementation plan.

At the same time you have to keep in mind that even the most sophisticated platform doesn’t provide any value by itself if it doesn’t meet expectations of your end users.

During this talk I’d like to present how Cognifide manages platforms composed of many applications, route traffic between smaller components and delivers content to users spread all over the world via Content Delivery Network (CDN)."""

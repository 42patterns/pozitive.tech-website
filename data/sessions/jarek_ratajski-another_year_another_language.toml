abstract = "No matter what language and which framework You use now, there is a big chance You will have to learn something new in a next few years. That is both a beauty and a curse of a coder job. But why does it work like that? Why can’t you simply learn one good enough technology and use it till retirement. Saving more time for family and hobbies. Or maybe You can? This talk is about evolution and history of software languages. Why don’t we write in FORTRAN anymore and who did not like ALGOL? Why functional programming is in fact older than assembly and how our mainstream (C++, Java and C#) looks like from a broader perspective. Can evolution end one day? Will there be the ultimate language, ever?"

language = "en"
abstract = "Can AI help us identify hate, abuse and misinformation online? If not, when might we be able to do so, if ever? Will AI actually just help us spread more misinformation and hate online? In this talk, we'll dive into some of the cutting edge research on hate-speech detection, bot army analysis and fake news. We'll explore what works, doesn't work and what may not be possible with current approaches alone. To conclude, we'll focus on what areas might be underserved and how every technologist can help fight these forms of hatred and deception online."

title = "Learning to Code: AI in Program Synthesis and Improvement"
language = "en"
abstract = "Programming consists in translating some form of user's intent into an executable computer program, and automating that process is known as program synthesis. A range of approaches to program synthesis have been proposed in the past, and recent progress in machine learning brought it much closer to practical applicability. In this talk, I will review selected approaches to program synthesis, with particular emphasis on recent developments, and discuss the implications both for AI as well as for the practice of software engineering."

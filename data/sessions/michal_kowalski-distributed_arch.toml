title = "Distributed architectures - behind the hype"
language = "en"
abstract = " We are surrounded by fancy, highly popular architecture concepts like microservices, cloud, lambdas, etc. Is this something more than just a hype-driven development? Should we drop all we learned through the years in favor of those new shiny approaches? How to design our systems in 2019 effectively? In this talk, I'd like to dive into some of the modern approaches and demystify the hype behind them. If you'd like to hear about practical aspects instead of technology marketing, this talk is just for you! Not only for architects & developers."
